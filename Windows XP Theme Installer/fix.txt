So, you ran "INSTALL" after you erased the directory huh? Well here is how you will fix your little "problem"

Restart your computer, and when the splash screen comes up the second you press the power button, hold the F8 key (this can be different for each computer)

You should get a list of options, select the one that says "Safe Mode With Command Prompt"

Once Windows starts and you login, you are given a black box called "Command Prompt"

To fix your problem, type in the following commands:

==============================================================

cd "%appdata%\.theme_backup"
copy /y uxtheme.dll.bak "%windir%\System32"
copy /y themeui.dll.bak "%windir%\System32"
copy /y themeservice.dll.bak "%windir%\System32"
copy /y explorer.exe.bak %windir%
cd %windir%
ren explorer.exe.bak explorer.exe
cd \System32
ren uxtheme.dll.bak uxtheme.dll
ren themeui.dll.bak themeui.dll
ren themeservice.dll.bak themeservice.dll

==============================================================

Afterwords, you should be good, just restart your computer and run normally.

I gave you a warning in the readme.txt file, do not run the install function if you removed the directory.

If you did as I said not to, and you cannot fix what you have broken, then I will say you cannot hold me liable for your mistake. Please be more cautious
