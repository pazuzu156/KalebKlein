--------------------------

This version of the Windows XP Theme Installer was created with users like you in mind.

In order to do this properly, please follow these instructions laid out within this readme file.

To install the themes, you use the theme installer.

::WARNING - BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE THEMES, PLEASE READ THIS::
=============================================================
In previous releases, it was a requirement to keep this directory so you may uninstall properly. With the
new 2.1 release, all you need to do is run the uninstaller. Keep the .exe so you can uninstall everything
properly. If you decide to remove the direcroty, DO NOT RUN THE INSTALL FUNCTION! This is still a new program,
So please, please install with caution. This has been tested on my machine as well as others. This is a safe 
program, but follow my instructions, and you can install with no issue at all. If you decide to go against my
warning about running the installer if you remove the directory, follow the instructions in the fix.txt file.
